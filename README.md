STRONGHOLD GAME: The Medieval Kingdom Simulator is a text-based strategy game that follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to model a kingdom management system. Players take on the role of a monarch, making decisions on taxation, military recruitment, resource management, and diplomacy while navigating economic challenges and maintaining public order.
This project effectively demonstrates core OOP concepts, with encapsulation, abstraction, and composition being particularly strong. With added design patterns, it could evolve into a more extensible and maintainable system.
